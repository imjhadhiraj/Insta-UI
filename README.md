# Instagram User Interface Clone

This project is a clone of the Instagram user interface, focused on the profile section. The interface features the user's profile picture, and the design closely follows Instagram's original style. Tailwind CSS is used to ensure the interface is responsive across different devices.

## Features

- **Instagram-inspired Design:** The UI is designed to closely mimic Instagram's aesthetics, providing a familiar user experience.
- **Responsive Layout:** Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Customizable Profile Picture:** The user's profile picture (currently yours) is prominently displayed.


### Prerequisites
